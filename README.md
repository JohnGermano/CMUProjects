# CMU_Projects
Coding projects completed during Carnegie Mellon Experience

Some things you should know:

1. Completed projects are sorted into different branches based on what language they are in (R, Python, SQL, etc.)
2. I intentionally have no license on all of my files, meaning you are not free to edit or distribute.
